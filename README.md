## Burger Builder Application (React)

What I used: 
* React 16
* Redux
* React-Router
* React-Thunk
* JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS3 w/ mobile first approach
* Webpack
* Backend/Database: Google Firebase
* Axios
* Firebase Authentication
* Unit Tests (Jest, Enzyme)


The Burger Builder application allows a user to build a burger by adding/removing ingredients and place the order if authenticated. An order summary is displayed upon checkout & user can proceed to checkout by filling out contact data. For mobile support (smaller screens), a toggle menu is implemented in place of the toolbar on the top.

Demo hosted via GitHub Pages: https://alicelu625.github.io/react-burger-builder/ 

Application was developed along with the [React course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:
##### `npm install`

then

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
