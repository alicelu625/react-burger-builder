The Burger Builder application allows the user to build a burger by adding/removing ingredients. An order summary is displayed upon checkout. For mobile support (smaller screens), a toggle menu is implemented in place of the toolbar on the top.

Demo hosted via GitHub Pages: https://alicelu625.github.io/react-burger-builder/ 

Application was developed along with the [React course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:
##### `npm install`

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
